# 🇩🇪 Artikel & Adjektivendungen – Trainer

An interactive web app for practicing **German articles and adjective endings** (Akkusativ, Dativ, Genitiv) with a focus on **understanding logic instead of memorization**.

I built this project because I personally struggled with adjective endings while learning German. After sharing it with tutors, fellow learners, and teachers, the feedback was consistently positive — so I decided to make it public and reusable.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive multiple-choice exercises  
- Clear progress tracking (question numbers, score, IDs)  
- Hint system (gender → case → translation)  
- Clickable **grammar rules** for each case (modal pop-ups, no page reload)  
- Multilingual help language (EN / UA, extensible)  
- Fully responsive (desktop & mobile friendly)  
- Randomized questions per round

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

Instead of forcing learners to memorize large tables, the app:
- explains **why** an ending is correct  
- connects endings to **case + gender + article type**  
- allows learners to check grammar rules *before guessing*  

This reduces frustration and speeds up learning significantly.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – custom design system, responsive layout, modal UI  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – state management, logic, validation  
- **JSON** – question bank and grammar data  

No frameworks, no dependencies — fast and lightweight.
